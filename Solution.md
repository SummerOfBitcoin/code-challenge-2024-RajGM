# Simulating Bitcoin

Based on my deep dive into Bitcoin's mechanics, I shaped my block construction program to closely emulate Bitcoin's real-world functions. 

I honed in on key areas like validating transactions, building Merkle trees, executing proof-of-work mining, and tweaking difficulty levels to mimic the secure, and efficiency nature of Bitcoin. 

This strategy helps my simulation capture the essence of blockchain technology, shedding light on the hurdles and decisions critical to sustaining a decentralized, robust digital currency ecosystem.

# Design Approach

The design of the block construction program revolves around simulating key aspects of Bitcoin’s operation, particularly transaction validation, block mining, and dynamic difficulty adjustment. 
The core objectives were to ensure transactions are valid, to mine blocks by solving cryptographic puzzles (proof-of-work), and to adjust the mining difficulty to maintain a target block time. 
Additional advanced features like fee market simulation and Merkle tree construction were considered to enhance realism.

## Key Concepts

### Transaction Validation

- **Objective**: Ensures only valid transactions (no double-spending, inputs >= outputs) are included in a block.
- **Implementation**: Each transaction is checked for its validity by ensuring that the total input value equals or exceeds the total output value, and that none of the inputs have been previously spent in the blockchain.

### Merkle Tree

- **Objective**: Efficiently summarizes all transactions in a block, allowing for quick verification of transaction inclusion without needing the entire block data.
- **Implementation**: Transactions are hashed in pairs to form the leaves of the Merkle tree, and these hashes are then combined and hashed iteratively until a single hash (the Merkle root) represents the entire set of transactions.

### Proof of Work & Mining

- **Objective**: Finds a nonce that, when hashed with the block’s header, produces a hash below a target difficulty, proving work has been done.
- **Implementation**: The block header, including the Merkle root, timestamp, and nonce, is hashed repeatedly, incrementing the nonce with each attempt, until the hash meets the network's difficulty target.

### Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment

- **Objective**: Adjusts the mining difficulty to maintain a consistent block time, reflecting changes in the network's computational power.
- **Implementation**: The difficulty target is adjusted every 2016 blocks to ensure the average time between blocks remains close to the target interval (e.g., 10 minutes for Bitcoin).

# Implementation Details

Below is a simplified pseudo code outlining the main functions necessary for implementing a block construction program simulating key aspects of Bitcoin's transaction processing and block mining.

## Pseudo Code

### Transaction Validation

```
function validateTransactions(transactions):
    for each transaction in transactions:
        if not isValidTransaction(transaction):
            remove transaction from transactions

function isValidTransaction(transaction):
    if doubleSpent(transaction) or inputs < outputs:
        return False
    return True
```
### Calculate Merkle Root

```
function calculateMerkleRoot(transactions):
    layer = hash each transaction
    while layer has more than one hash:
        layer = hash pairs of hashes in layer
    return layer[0]
```

### Adjust Difficulty
```
function adjustDifficulty(lastBlockTime, targetBlockTime):
    if lastBlockTime < targetBlockTime:
        increase difficulty
    else:
        decrease difficulty
```

### Mine Block
```
function mineBlock(transactions, difficulty):
    merkleRoot = calculateMerkleRoot(transactions)
    nonce = findValidNonce(merkleRoot, difficulty)
    return new Block(nonce, merkleRoot, transactions)
```

### Find Valid Nonce
```
function findValidNonce(merkleRoot, difficulty):
    nonce = 0
    while not validProof(merkleRoot, nonce, difficulty):
        nonce += 1
    return nonce
```

### Check Valid Proof
```
function validProof(merkleRoot, nonce, difficulty):
    hash = hash(merkleRoot + nonce)
    return hash < difficulty
```
